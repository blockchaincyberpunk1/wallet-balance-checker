## Tests
 
Pre-requisites:
Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your machine.
Make sure all project dependencies are installed by running npm install in the project directory.
Running Unit Tests:
Navigate to the Project Directory: Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the Wallet Balance Checker project.

Run the Test Script: Execute the following command to start the test runner:
npm test

Observe Test Output: The terminal will display the test results. Each test will be marked as either passed (✓) or failed (✗).

Review Failed Tests: If any tests fail, review the output to understand what went wrong. The test description and error message should provide insight into what aspect of the functionality is not working as expected.

Fix Issues if Necessary: If there are failed tests, make the necessary changes to the code to fix the issues. After making changes, go back to step 2 to run the tests again.

Check Test Coverage (Optional): If you have set up test coverage reporting for your project, you can run the following command to generate a coverage report:
npm run test:coverage

Review the coverage report to ensure that all parts of your application are covered by tests.

Running End-to-End Tests (If Applicable):
If you have set up end-to-end tests using a tool like Cypress or Selenium, follow these additional steps:

Start the Application: In a separate terminal window, start the application by running:
npm start

Run End-to-End Tests: In another terminal window, execute the command to run your end-to-end tests. This command will depend on the tool you are using. For example, if you are using Cypress, you might run:
npx cypress open

Review Test Results: Observe the test results in the terminal or the tool's user interface. Make sure all tests pass.

Fix Issues if Necessary: If any end-to-end tests fail, review the output, fix any issues, and re-run the tests.
